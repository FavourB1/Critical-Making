  <summary>PAST: Challenged Expectations</summary>
  <blockquote>"It is a maze of linked and abbreviated ideas searching for coherence..." — Joshua Reinier
  <p>
    When I began this course, I expected <strong>critical making</strong> to feel rigid—like applied critical theory with technical demands. 
    Instead, it revealed itself as a <strong>flexible, evolving mindset</strong>, one that values <em>messiness</em>, <em>glitches</em>, and <em>incomplete paths</em> just as much as polished outcomes.
  </p>
  <p>
    I learned that <strong>making</strong> isn't about technological mastery. It’s about risk, reflection, and radical openness. 
    This realization shifted my perception of both academic work and creative practice.

  <summary>PRESENT: Excited Experiments</summary>
  <p><strong>Projects I want to keep alive:</strong> Comic Creation | Data Analysis</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Comic Creation</strong> allowed me to break research into narrative fragments, letting humor, affect, and critique coexist.</li>
    <li><strong>Data Analysis with Voyant Tools</strong> turned texts into landscapes, revealing networks and hidden patterns.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Both experiences opened new possibilities for my future work: <em>multi-modal, experimental, and audience-centered</em>.</p>

  <summary>FUTURE: Tools, Theories, Manifesto</summary>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Voyant Tools</strong> remains in my research toolkit.</li>
    <li><strong>Design Justice</strong> has become a foundational lens for all projects.</li>
  </ul>
  <p><strong>My Critical Making Reflection:</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>Embrace the glitch.</li>
    <li>Design <em>with</em> communities, not <em>for</em> them.</li>
    <li>Value curiosity, not control.</li>
    <li>Treat every project as a conversation, not a monologue.</li>
  </ul>
</details>

<h2>A Final Note</h2>
<p><em>Critical making is not a static outcome 
It is a living, breathing, glitching, growing process.</em></p>
<p><strong>And that's the point.</strong></p>
