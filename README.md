# Critical Making: A Reflection on Process, Platforms, and Purpose

This semester has been a journey in expanding what I thought research and making could be. I came into the course expecting technical experimentation, but I leave with a deeper understanding that critical making is as much about philosophy and intention as it is about tools.

Through platforms like [Bitsy](https://make.bitsy.org/), [Twine](https://twinery.org/), [p5.js](https://p5js.org/), [Google Earth](https://earth.google.com/), and [Voyant Tools](https://voyant-tools.org/), I explored not just content creation, but the politics, aesthetics, and ethics of making. One of the most significant steps in this process was engaging with [GitHub](https://github.com/) not merely as a storage site, but as a critical space for sharing, versioning, and shaping ideas in public.

GitHub became a medium where I could test my HTML designs, reflect on my progress, and publish my evolving reflections. You can view my project repository [here](https://www.canva.com/design/DAGlOYt4eAc/WCJKQlQ18RG60sfUFw9Gkw/edit?utm_content=DAGlOYt4eAc&utm_campaign=designshare&utm_medium=link2&utm_source=sharebutton). It helped me visualize the notion of “version control” in a more philosophical sense where each commit was like a dialogue with my past self. This became particularly meaningful in the final phase of the course as I transformed my written reflection into a hypertext HTML page. This act of publishing was not about perfection, but about process visibility, an idea at the heart of critical making.

The projects that resonated most - data visualization with Voyant Tools and creative experimentation with comics and narrative design, demonstrated to me that multimodal scholarship allows us to think beyond academic silos. These exercises helped me bridge theory and practice in ways that felt relevant to real-world digital environments, from interactive learning systems to public storytelling platforms.

Looking ahead, my goal is to carry forward these engagements into the field of educational and digital communication, particularly in the context of my PhD focus in Digital Media. I see potential in using critical making as a methodology for meaningful engagement,especially with underrepresented audiences in education and media. Whether designing curriculum, building participatory web experiences, or analyzing the politics of interface design, I want to use my skills to question systems, design more equitable media, and foster interactive, reflective learning.

Tools like GitHub, Voyant, Twine, and others will remain central to my methodology, not simply because they’re useful, but because they help surface questions about accessibility, authorship, and audience. I also plan to integrate frameworks such as [Design Justice](https://design-justice.pubpub.org/) to ensure my work remains grounded in inclusive and accountable practices.

In short, this course has not only deepened my technical and creative capacities, it has given me a new academic identity. I now see myself as a critical maker: someone who learns through doing, who reflects through sharing, and who designs for dialogue rather than display. I take this forward not just as a set of tools, but as a philosophy of practice that I will continue to build on in both my dissertation work and my future career in digital education and communication.
